## **Main Outline:**

---

<br>

### **1. Plan your project**

Visualize your end result. What is it built with? What can it do? Make sure that it satisfies all of the project objectives.

Make a timeline for yourself and avoid the temptation to build things that aren’t required. Setting firm boundaries and deadlines will keep you on track and prevent scope creep.

The following tasks will help you identify natural break points.

<br>

### **2. Wireframe your website**

Using pencil and paper, or a wireframing software of your choice, draft what you’d like your portfolio to look like

<br>

### **3. Build the Home Page**

The home page will be the main page that users visit. It should prominently feature your name, along with a selection of several projects that you are most proud of. Each project should have a picture, a summary of the project, and the technology used to build it.

<br>

### **4. Build the Contact / About Me Page**

The contact page includes your email address, as well as any other relevant information such as your LinkedIn profile or a personal photo.

<br>

### **5. Style the content**

Now that you have your content, consider how you would like it to look. Do you want to arrange your projects in a grid? In an asymmetrical arrangement? What colors do you want to use to personalize the page?

<br>

### **6. Make it interactive**

Use JavaScript to add interactivity to your website.

<br>

### **7. Make it responsive**

Use responsive design to ensure that your page is viewable on multiple devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

<br>
